# Randomize Meet Participants

Chrome extension that randomize Google Meet participants into a list. This is useful to set speaking order in the meeting.

It includes 2 options:

- Shuffle (generates a randomly sorted list of names)
- Add custom list (opens an input to add custom participants)

## Disclaimer ⚠🐛

This extension does not use any API because Google Meet does not offer it. Maybe the extension could break when Google updates the interface of Meet. Feel free to open a PR or create an issue if you experience any issues.
